# Vault Java SDK Sample - vsdk-object-sample

**Please see the [project wiki](https://github.com/smehtaca/vsdk-object-sample/wiki) for a detailed walkthrough.**

The vsdk-object-sample project covers the creation of a vSDK Product record and related vSDK Country Brand records. The project will step through:

* Field defaulting, field validation, and conditionally required fields on the vSDK Product record.
* Creating related vSDK Country Brand records based on the vSDK Region associated with the vSDK Product record.
* The creation of the vSDK Country Brand records will kick off a workflow on each country brand record.
* The completion of the workflow will trigger a state change (update) to the vSDK Country Brand record and it's associated vSDK Product record.
* A custom User Action to change the owner role of a vSDK Product's related vSDK Country Brand records.

## How to import

Import the project as a Maven project. This will automatically pull in the required Vault Java SDK dependencies. 

For Intellij this is done by:
- File > Open > Navigate to project folder > Select the 'pom.xml' file > Open as Project

For Eclipse this is done by:
- File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects > Navigate to project folder > Select the 'pom.xml' file


## Setup

The project contains two separate vault packages (VPK) in the "deploy-vpk" directory with the necessary Objects, Actions, Lifecycles, Workflows, and custom object actions for the following examples.

The  **VPKs need to be deployed to your vault**  prior to debugging these use cases:

1.  Clone or download the sample Maven project [vSDK Object Sample project](https://github.com/veeva/vsdk-object-sample) from GitHub.
2.  Run through the [Getting Started](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Getting_Started) guide to set up your deployment environment.
3.  Log in to your vault and navigate to **Admin > Deployment > Inbound Packages** and click **Import**: 

    > Deploy Object Action code:  Select the **\deploy-vpk\code\vsdk-object-sample-action-code.vpk** file.

4.  From the **Actions** menu, select **Review & Deploy**. Vault displays a list of all components in the package.  
5.  Review the prompts to deploy the package. You will receive an email when the deployment is complete.
6.  Repeat steps 3-5 for the vault components:

    > Deploy vault components:  Select the **\deploy-vpk\vsdk-object-sample-components\vsdk-object-sample-components.vpk** file.


## How to run

To see the project in action, configure the  [debugger](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Debug_Setup) and set breakpoints or [deploy](https://developer.veevavault.com/sdk/#Deploy) the code to your Vault.

Once the project is in debug or deployed to vault:

1.  Navigate to your  **Admin > Business Admin > vSDK Product** tab in your vault and  **Create** a new record.
2.  Enter any value in the  **Name** field.
3.  Click  **Save**.
4.  While vault attempts to save the record, each of the trigger examples discussed below will run.
